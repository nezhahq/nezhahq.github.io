## Real IP Request Header

- `CF-Connecting-IP` is a header used to identify the visitor's real IP address.  
- When accessing the Dashboard through a Cloudflare CDN proxy, enabling this feature allows the origin server to correctly recognize the visitor's real IP.  
  - **Purpose**: Facilitates security audits, firewall rule configuration, and accurate logging.

::: danger   
1. **Be Careful with Header Configuration**  
   The Real IP Request Header impacts the proper functioning of the built-in Web Application Firewall (WAF).  
   If you are unfamiliar with header handling, avoid modifying this setting. Incorrect configuration may result in the IP being blocked by the WAF.

2. **Prevent Account Brute Force Attacks**  
   The built-in WAF is designed to prevent brute force attacks on local accounts.  
   - Without protective measures, attackers could attempt high-frequency password enumeration (e.g., 100 attempts per second).  
   - The WAF relies on accurate IP identification via properly configured headers to block such attacks.

3. **Security Recommendations**  
   Only enable this feature if you understand the header transmission mechanism. Thoroughly test your configuration after enabling.

## IP Change Notification

This feature sends a notification when a server's IP address changes. Configure it as follows:

### Configuration Options

1. **Coverage Scope**  
   Select a rule to determine which servers to monitor for IP changes.

2. **Specific Servers**  
   Use this setting to exclude specific servers from the selected rule.

3. **Send Notifications to a Group**  
   Choose a notification group. (Notification methods must be pre-configured in the `Notifications` page.)

4. **Enable the Feature**  
   Check the **Enable** option to activate notifications.

5. **Show Full IP Address in Notifications**  
   By default, IP change notifications mask full IP addresses.  
   To display full IPs, enable this option.

## User Management

This tab allows you to add multiple users to the dashboard.  

For details, refer to [Multi-User](/en_US/guide/user.html).

---

## Online Users

View information about visitors/users currently connected to the frontend, including **IP** and **connection time**, with the ability to manually block users.

---

## Web Application Firewall

View current blocked entries with useful information:

- **IP**: The IP of the blocked user.
- **Block Identifier**: The identifier for the resource attacked by the blocked user. Typically a user ID, but in special cases:
  1. Attempting to crack a gRPC connection key;
  2. Attempting to crack an API token;
  3. Attempting to log into a nonexistent user;
  4. Manual blocking (via the "Online Users" page).
- **Count**: The number of times this block entry has been triggered. Higher counts result in longer block durations.
- **Block Reason**: The reason for the last block on this entry.
- **Ban Time**: The time of the last block on this entry.

If the current user is an administrator, they can manually delete block entries.
