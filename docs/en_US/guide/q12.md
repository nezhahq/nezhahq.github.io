# Frontend Real IP Header Configuration

With the introduction of local account mechanisms in V1, accurate retrieval of the clientâ€™s real IP address is essential to prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints (Web Application Firewall functionality).  
This feature can be managed via **`/dashboard/settings/waf`**.

---

## Configuration Scenarios

Depending on how the service is deployed, there are two primary configuration scenarios:

### 1. Direct Public Access to the Dashboard

- Enable **`Use Direct IP`** in the settings. No additional configuration is required.

---

### 2. Deployment Behind a Web Proxy or CDN

- Refer to the [Reverse Proxy Configuration](/en_US/guide/q3.html) documentation.
- The configuration examples utilize the `nz-realip` header for transmitting client IP addresses. You can either use this default header or define your own.
- Ensure the proxy server is correctly set up to include the client IP in the custom header and forward it to the Dashboard.

## Common Issues

### Q1: What if a configuration error causes the Dashboard to be inaccessible or agents to disconnect?

1. Modify the Dashboard configuration file:  
   Locate the configuration file at `/data/config.yaml` and update the following entry:
   ```yaml
   realipheader: ""
   ```
   Set the `realipheader` value to an empty string (`""`), save, and exit.

2. Restart the Dashboard service.

3. Access the Dashboard again and verify if the connection is restored.
