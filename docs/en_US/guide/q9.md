# Enable GPU monitoring

GPU monitoring is a new feature implemented in Nezha Monitoring v0.17.x. Before using the feature, please ensure your Dashboard version is higher than v0.17.2 and Agent version is higher than v0.17.0.

## Enable

### From Command-Line Flag

Append the `--gpu` flag to the Agent argument. For example:

```bash
/opt/nezha/agent/nezha-agent -s example.com:5555 -p example --gpu
```

### From configuration file

Execute the following command to modify Agent configuration to enable GPU monitoring.

```bash
/opt/nezha/agent/nezha-agent edit
```

In the interactive menu returned, choose to enable GPU monitoring.

## Enable GPU utilization monitoring

GPU model and GPU utilization are two different monitor items, which uses different approaches to obtain their value.

Windows and macOS supports getting GPU utilization without extra dependencies, and support multiple graphics card brands.

Linux distros support only NVIDIA and AMD cards and need to install extra dependencies.

Below are the instructions on how to enable GPU utilization monitoring on Linux for NVIDIA / AMD graphics cards.

### NVIDIA

NVIDIA cards need the `nvidia-smi` utility to get GPU utilization. This utility is included in the official driver by default.

If you use unofficial drivers like `nouveau`, then it's not possible to get GPU utilization.

### AMD

AMD cards need to install the open source `amdgpu` driver and the `rocm-smi` utility.

Mainstream distros have already packaged `rocm-smi`, below are commands to install the utility on these distros:

```bash
# Arch Linux
pacman -Sy rocm-smi-lib

# Debian / Ubuntu
apt install rocm-smi

# Fedora / RHEL 8+
dnf install rocm-smi
```

If your distro doesn't have the package, then you will need to compile `rocm_smi_lib` manually.

Required dependenciesï¼š`git` `cmake` `gcc`

First, clone the git repository of `rocm_smi_lib`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib
```

Then compile the libraries and install them on your system.

```bash
cd rocm_smi_lib
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j $(nproc)
# Install library file and header; default location is /opt/rocm
make install
```
