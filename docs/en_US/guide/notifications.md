# Notification Configuration

Nezha Monitoring supports monitoring server load, CPU, memory, disk, traffic, monthly traffic, process count, and connection count, and sending notifications when user-defined thresholds are reached.

## Flexible Notification Methods

- In Dashboard messages, the placeholder `#DATETIME#` represents the timestamp of the event. When the notification is triggered, the Dashboard automatically replaces `#DATETIME#` with the actual event time.
- `#NEZHA#` is a placeholder for Dashboard messages, and the Dashboard automatically replaces the placeholder with the actual message when the notification is triggered.
- The body content is in `JSON` format: **When the request type is FORM**, the value is in `key:value` form, and placeholders can be placed inside `value`. The placeholders will be automatically replaced during notification. **When the request type is JSON**, only simple string replacement is performed before being submitted to the `URL`.
- Placeholders can also be placed inside the URL, and simple string replacement will be performed during the request.

**Refer to the following notification method examples, and you can also flexibly set the push method according to your needs.**

## Notification Rule Explanation

### Basic Rules

- `type`: You can choose one or more types. If multiple types are selected in one rule, **all selected types must be satisfied** to trigger a notification (refer to the examples below)
  - `cpu`, `gpu`, `memory`, `swap`, `disk`
  - `net_in_speed` inbound network speed, `net_out_speed` outbound network speed, `net_all_speed` total network speed, `transfer_in` inbound traffic, `transfer_out` outbound traffic, `transfer_all` total traffic
  - `offline` offline monitoring
  - `load1`, `load5`, `load15` load
  - `process_count` process count (currently resource-intensive due to thread count, not supported temporarily)
  - `tcp_conn_count`, `udp_conn_count` connection count
  - `temperature_max` maximum temperature
- `duration`: Duration in seconds. An notification is triggered if 30% or more of the samples exceed the threshold within this duration (to prevent data spikes).
- `min` or `max`:
  - For traffic and network speed, the unit is bytes (1KB = 1024B, 1MB = 1024 * 1024B)
  - For memory, disk, and CPU, the unit is percentage
  - No need to set this for offline monitoring
- `cover`: 
  - `0` monitors all servers, use `ignore` to exclude specific servers
  - `1` ignores all servers, use `ignore` to monitor specific servers  
  Example: `[{"type":"offline","duration":10, "cover":0, "ignore":{"5": true}}]`
- `ignore`: Select specific servers to exclude, used with `cover`, content is server ID and boolean value, e.g., `{"1": true, "2": false}`

**Complete Examples:**  

Add an offline notification:

- Name: Offline Notification
- Rule: `[{"Type":"offline","Duration":10}]`
- Enabled: √

Add an notification for CPU usage exceeding 50% for 10 seconds **and** memory usage below 20% for 20 seconds:

- Name: CPU+Memory
- Rule: `[{"Type":"cpu","Min":0,"Max":50,"Duration":10},{"Type":"memory","Min":20,"Max":0,"Duration":20}]`
- Enabled: √

Send notifications for specific servers to specific notification groups:

Scenario example:  
There are 4 servers (1, 2, 3, 4) and two notification groups (A, B).  
Notify group A if servers 1 and 2 are offline for 10 minutes.  
Notify group B if servers 3 and 4 are offline for 10 minutes.

First, set up notification groups A and B, then add two notification rules:

**Rule 1:**

- Name: 1, 2 Offline, Send to Notification Group A
- Rule: `[{"type":"offline","duration":600,"cover":1,"ignore":{"1":true,"2":true}}]`
- Notification Group: A
- Enabled: √

**Rule 2:**

- Name: 3, 4 Offline, Send to Notification Group B
- Rule: `[{"type":"offline","duration":600,"cover":1,"ignore":{"3":true,"4":true}}]`
- Notification Group: B
- Enabled: √

**Flexibly using parameters can make your notification function fully utilized**

### Special: Any Cycle Traffic notification

Can be used for monthly traffic monitoring

- `type`:
  - `transfer_in_cycle` inbound traffic during the cycle
  - `transfer_out_cycle` outbound traffic during the cycle
  - `transfer_all_cycle` total traffic during the cycle
- `cycle_start`: The start date of the statistical cycle (can be the start date of your server billing cycle). The time format is RFC3339, e.g., Beijing time is `2022-01-11T08:00:00.00+08:00`
- `cycle_interval`: The number of statistical cycle units (e.g., if the cycle unit is days, and this value is 7, it means statistics are collected every 7 days)
- `cycle_unit`: Statistical cycle unit, default is `hour`, optional (`hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`)
- `min/max`, `cover`, `ignore` refer to basic rule configuration

Example:  

For servers with IDs 3 and 4 (defined in ignore), if the monthly outbound traffic exceeds 1TB starting from the 1st of each month, send an notification:

```json
[{"type":"transfer_out_cycle","max":1099511627776,"cycle_start":"2022-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","cycle_interval":1,"cycle_unit":"month","cover":1,"ignore":{"3":true,"4":true}}]
```

::: tip
If you still have trouble editing rules, you can try the rule generators below to simplify the process. Note that Nezha Monitoring does not guarantee the functionality of these generated rules.

- [Nezha Rule Generator](https://nz.sina.us.kg/): for common cases
- [Nezha-Traffic-Alarm-Generator](https://wiziscool.github.io/Nezha-Traffic-Alarm-Generator/): for editing cycle traffic rules only and may be more convenient to use. Chinese only.
:::

## Notification Trigger Modes

- **Always Trigger**: A notification is triggered every time the Agent reports a status that matches the notification rule.
- **Single Trigger**: A notification is triggered only once when the status changes, such as from normal to abnormal or from abnormal to normal.

## Set Tasks to Execute on notifications

If you need to execute a task while sending an notification message, you can set this item.

- **Task on Notification**: The task to be executed when the notification status changes from "normal" to "event". The task should be set in the tasks page in advance.
- **Task on Recovery**: The task to be executed when the notification status changes from "event" to "normal". The task should be set in the tasks page in advance.
