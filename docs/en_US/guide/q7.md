# Customizing Agent Monitoring Items

The Agent's functionality and behavior can be tailored to specific monitoring needs by configuring its runtime parameters.

---

## Runtime Parameters

### Configuration Parameters

If you installed the Agent using the one-click script, you can edit the `/opt/nezha/agent/config.yml` file to add or modify parameters.  
Multiple Agents can run on the same server, and each Agent's configuration file is independent.

Below is a list of runtime parameters and their functions:

- **`client_secret:`**  
  - The client secret used for secure communication with the Dashboard.  
  - This parameter must match the configuration in the Dashboard to enable proper communication.

- **`debug:`**  
  - When set to `true`, enables logging.

- **`disable_auto_update:`**  
  - When set to `true`, disables the automatic update feature, enhancing system stability and security.

- **`disable_command_execute:`**  
  - When set to `true`, rejects **Command Execution**, **Online Terminal** and **File Manager** tasks.

- **`disable_force_update:`**  
  - When set to `true`, disables forced updates, allowing only manual updates.

- **`disable_nat:`**  
  - When set to `true`, rejects **NAT** tasks.

- **`disable_send_query:`**  
  - When set to `true`, rejects **TCPing**, **ICMP Ping**, and **HTTP GET** tasks.

- **`gpu:`**  
  - When set to `true`, enables GPU monitoring.  
  - Note: Additional dependencies may be required for GPU monitoring. See the [GPU Monitoring Guide](/en_US/guide/q9.html) for details.

- **`insecure_tls:`**  
  - When set to `true`, disables certificate validation, suitable for scenarios using self-signed certificates.

- **`ip_report_period:`**  
  - Sets the interval (in seconds) for local IP updates. The default is `1800` seconds (30 minutes).  
  - The valid minimum value is `30`.

- **`report_delay:`**  
  - Sets the interval (in seconds) for system information reporting. The default is `3` seconds (valid range: 1-4 seconds).

- **`server:`**  
  - The domain or IP address of the Dashboard for communication, including the port number.

- **`skip_connection_count:`**  
  - When set to `true`, disables monitoring of network connection counts, suitable for servers with high connection volumes or limited resources.

- **`skip_procs_count:`**  
  - When set to `true`, disables monitoring of process counts to lower resource usage.

- **`temperature:`**  
  - When set to `true`, enables hardware temperature monitoring (only supported for specific hardware; unavailable for some VPS instances).

- **`tls:`**  
  - When set to `true`, enables SSL/TLS encryption for communication between the Agent and the Dashboard.  
  - Enable this option if the Agent uses an SSL/TLS-enabled Nginx reverse proxy.

- **`hard_drive_partition_allowlist:`**  
  - A string array specifying the list of hard drive partitions to monitor.  
  - Monitoring will only include the listed partitions.

- **`nic_allowlist:`**  
  - A `map[string]bool` type whitelist specifying the network interfaces to monitor.  
  - The key is the network interface name, and the value is `true` for monitoring and `false` for exclusion.  
  - If not specified, all available interfaces are monitored by default.

- **`use_gitee_to_upgrade:`**  
  - When set to `true`, uses the Gitee repository as the automatic update source, better suited for servers in mainland China.

- **`use_ipv6_country_code:`**  
  - When set to `true`, forces the use of IPv6 addresses for country code queries (default uses IPv4).

- **`uuid:`**  
  - The unique identifier for the current Agent, used by the Dashboard to recognize the data source.  
  - To replace an existing Agent in the Dashboard, manually set this parameter.

- **`dns:`**  
  - A string array to set custom DNS server lists.  
  - When specified, the Agent will prioritize these DNS servers for domain resolution.

- **`custom_ip_api:`**  
  - A string array specifying custom IP query API endpoints.  
  - The Agent will use these APIs to retrieve the server's public IP information.

- **`self_update_period`**
  - Set the update interval manually (in minutes).
  - Defaults to a random value between `30` and `90`.

## Apply Changes

After modifying the configuration file, restart the Agent service to apply changes. Follow these steps:

1. **Restart the Service**  
   Use the following command to restart the default Agent service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nezha-agent.service
   ```

2. **For Multiple Agent Services**  
   If running multiple Agent services on the same server, first list all Agent services:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl list-units --type=service | grep nezha-agent
   ```
   Then restart each Agent service using the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart <service-name>
   ```
   Replace `<service-name>` with the actual service name, such as `nezha-agent@2.service`.
