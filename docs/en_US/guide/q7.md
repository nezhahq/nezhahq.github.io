# Custom Agent Monitoring Projects

## Customizing Monitored Network Interfaces and Disk Partitions

Execute the following command to select custom network interfaces and partitions, then restart the Agent for the changes to take effect:

```bash
/opt/nezha/agent/nezha-agent edit
```

## Other Runtime Parameters

To view the supported parameters, execute:

```bash
./nezha-agent --help
```

If you installed the Agent using the one-click script, you can edit `/etc/systemd/system/nezha-agent.service` and add the following parameters at the end of the `ExecStart=` line:

- `--report-delay`: Controls the interval for reporting system information. The default is 1 second. You can set it to 3 to further reduce the agent's system resource usage (configuration range: 1-4).
- `--skip-conn`: Does not monitor connection counts. Recommended for servers with high connection density or high CPU usage.
- `--skip-procs`: Does not monitor process counts, which can also reduce Agent resource usage.
- `--disable-auto-update`: Disables **automatic updates** for the Agent (security feature).
- `--disable-force-update`: Disables **forced updates** for the Agent (security feature).
- `--disable-command-execute`: Disables the execution of scheduled tasks and the opening of the online terminal on the Agent (security feature).
- `--tls`: Enables SSL/TLS encryption (required if you use nginx to reverse proxy the Agent's gRPC connection and nginx has SSL/TLS enabled).
