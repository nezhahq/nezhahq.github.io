# Initialize User Password

If you forget the user password stored in the local database, it cannot be retrieved as it is encrypted using `bcrypt`. However, you can reset it by creating a default user account and then updating the password to your preference.

---

## Steps to Reset the Password

### 1. Stop the Dashboard Service

To ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts, it is recommended to stop the Dashboard before modifying the database.

---

### 2. Locate the Database File

The database file is typically located at:
```plaintext
/opt/nezha/dashboard/data/sqlite.db
```

---

### 3. Query and Reset the User Table

Use the SQLite command-line tool to interact with the database:

1. **Query Existing Users**:
   Run the following command to list all existing users:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 /opt/nezha/dashboard/data/sqlite.db "SELECT * FROM users;"
   ```

2. **Clear the User Table**:
   If you need to reset the user table, run the following command to delete all user records:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 /opt/nezha/dashboard/data/sqlite.db "DELETE FROM users;"
   ```

---

### 4. Restart the Dashboard 

After modifying the database, restart the Dashboard to apply changes.

---

### 5. Login Using the Default Account

During initialization, the Dashboard checks if the user table is empty. If it is, a default user account is created automatically.  
You can log in with the following credentials:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`

---

## Post-Reset Actions

Once logged in, it is strongly recommended to change the default password immediately for security reasons:
1. Go to **Profile â†’ Personal Info**.
2. Select **Update Profile**.
3. Set a new, secure password.

---

## Important Notes

- **Backup Before Modifying**: Always create a backup of the database before making any changes:
  ```bash
  cp /opt/nezha/dashboard/data/sqlite.db /opt/nezha/dashboard/data/sqlite.db.bak
  ```
- **Caution**: Clearing the user table will remove all existing user accounts, including administrators. Proceed only if you are certain about the operation.
