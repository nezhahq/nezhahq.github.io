# Internationalization (i18n)

## Introduction

You can contribute to Nezhaâ€™s internationalization efforts through [Hosted Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/nezha/).

## Scope of Coverage

All Dashboard-side projects, including **Nezha** itself, the official user frontend and the admin frontend.

## Note

When adding new text to `nezhahq/nezha`, in addition to using specific translation functions, you also need to manually update the templates:

```bash
./script/i18n.sh generate template
```

After that, Weblate will automatically update the repository, allowing you to continue the translation work.
