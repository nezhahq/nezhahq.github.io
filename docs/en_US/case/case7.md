Broker for Nezha is a modified version of the Nezha Agent that separates data collection from gRPC reporting, enabling small devices to connect to the Nezha Dashboard.

Online Documentation: [Broker for Nezha](https://broker.kuzu.uk/)

## Difference from Nezha Agent
- Utilizes external data sources to report to **Nezha Dashboard**.
- Supports configuring multiple sources and connecting to multiple Dashboards.
- Currently supports two task types only: `TaskTypeCommand` and `TaskTypeTerminalGRPC`, implemented using SSH. Other task types are not planned.

Broker for Nezha needs to be used with specific data collection software. Currently, it provides two data acquisition methods:
1. HTTP (HTTP/1.1) - Active polling
2. TCP - Passive collection (recommended to avoid creating new connections)

For existing data collection software, refer to the project README. Due to security concerns, it's recommended to use this only in a trusted network.

## Writing a Data Collector
If you need to write your own data collector, you'll need to implement a basic HTTP server or TCP client and use a specific data format that Broker can recognize. For details, see: [Data types](https://broker.kuzu.uk/en/configuration/type/)
